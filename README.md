<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Hangman Game was the first project I've ever built with Python, it had a graphical stick man on a command line and though it was ONLY a command line game I liked it a lot! These times today I'm refining my Front-End skills and decided developing this game again by now using a more complex way of handling the game with some features such as diffculty levels, API for random words, and a fairly not-so-simple state management with Redux, that is dependent and changing by the different slices values.

* It took me couple of days to built this to fully function the way I initially wanted to.
* There is a strong useage of custom hooks here, this made my life way easier handling functionalities across the application.
* TypeScript kept me from making all sort of mistakes and development was definitelly sped up by that.

Of course, no project is perfect, I've got some cute ideas for this project, you're all more than welcome to post features suggestions and even help! <3

### Built With

The project was really comfortable to develop using TypeScript, Custom Hooks and Redux.
Vite is a super-fast way to develop react apps these days. Tailwind has given me the tools to rapidly create
Dark / Light modes, and building even the simplest to the most complex layouts in no-time.
